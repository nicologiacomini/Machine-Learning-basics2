# Machine Learning basics part 2
In this repo I upload my Machine Learning project. This is the following part of Machine Learning basics.

## Homework 2
In this homework I applied data driven techniques for building a graph in IoT networks. Here I used 3 different techiniques: Distance Based, Graphical Lasso (GLASSO) and Graph Signal Processing (GSP).

## Homework 3
In this homework I built Black Carbon proxy for air quality sensor monitor networks. Here I used several data sensor and I applied different methods for the selection of the features: Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest Regression, Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFNN), Gaussian Process (GP), Kernel Ridge Regression (KR) and K-Nearst Neighbors (KNN)

## Homework 4
In this homework I applied some missing value imputation (MVI) in IoT. I generated some missing in the dataset. Then I applied different methods to try to input the data: Polynomial, MLR, LSTM, KNN and AE.
